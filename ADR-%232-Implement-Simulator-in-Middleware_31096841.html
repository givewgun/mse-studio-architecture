                    <p><strong>Context:Â </strong></p><p>Adrich currently separates the data processing into another service called middleware, which will handle all of the necessary data transformations by processing it or delegating the task and calling an external api service to process the data, which then will be sent back to middleware to be transformed and send it back to backend API.  We would like to implement a feature extractor here as it will reuse the existing architecture which offers modularity and high modifiability as engineers can configure which middleware to use for a specific product. </p><p>However, this method involves one service calling another and sometimes engaging in a chain of three or more services to compute and return the final result to the initiating service. This process leads to considerable communication overhead, significantly slowing down the system. In the new system, we plan to use the middleware without calling external API to reduce communication overhead while preserving the maintainability and Modifiability.</p><p /><p><strong>Quality Attributes related:</strong></p><ul><li><p>QA - Maintainability</p></li><li><p>QA - Modifiability</p></li></ul><p /><p><strong>Decision:</strong></p><p>We will implement a feature extractor in the middleware without calling an external service to run it. The new middleware will handle fetching a simulator executable database and running it, as there is little overhead when fetching the executable and running it, as it is very lightweight.</p><p /><p><strong>Status:</strong></p><p>Agreed</p><p /><p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Simplified Architecture and Easy for maintainance: Reusing existing architecture will make the system easier to maintain.</p></li><li><p>Improve Modifiability: Consolidation may compromise the modifiability of the system by combining multiple responsibilities into a single service, potentially making future changes more complex.</p></li><li><p>Easy transition: By reusing the existing architecture and the same operation flow, it will be easier for moving the data pipeline to a new one for new label</p></li><li><p>Increased Latency: By calling middleware, there will be some overhead instead of directly running the simulator in the backend API</p></li></ul>
